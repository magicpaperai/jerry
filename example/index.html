        Man, as we know him, is a comparative late-comer in the history of the
        Earth and tenuous film of life which its surface has supported. In certain
        respects he is one of the most fragile of living creatures—yet, in the
        manner of his explosive appearance on the scene, and the ways in which he
        has profoundly altered the environment within which he developed, he is the
        most powerful organism to have emerged so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ‘power’ to which we will often refer, (and indeed upon which this entire
        report is a commentary) is not visible physical power, but rather the wholly
        invisible power of the brain. Linnaeus, the eminent Swedish botanist, first
        gave the name <em>homo sapiens</em> to our present human strain. The wisdom (or
        “sapien”) referred to is not so developed in the traditional sense as we might
        desire, but as intellect or brain power it is awesomely demonstrable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet the difference between man and other organisms seems still only a
        matter of degree—of relative weight of brain, perhaps, and the number of
        its surface convolutions—but it is a marginal difference which is
        sufficient to alter significantly the way in which man has so far
        evolved. This difference has served to provide two main characteristics
        which set him apart from all other creatures. One is the ability to
        transmit his consciously accumulated knowledge from one generation to
        another and across many generations, and the other to externalise his
        organic functions into extent fabricated from his material
        environment—his tools. These features, combined, have enabled man, in
        spite of his relatively puny physical stature, to adapt himself to his
        environment so that he has been able to survive severe climatic and other
        changes, and to spread swiftly out into every corner of the Earth.
      </p>
      <div data-jerry-type="blackbox">
        <span data-jerry-type="signpost" class='signpost'>[</span>
        <em>Some intervening text that should not interfere with addressing system.</em>
        <span data-jerry-type="signpost" class='signpost'>]</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        His capacity to transcend the temporal limits of his own life span by
        communicating his thought and feelings through many generations has given him
        an unique ‘continuous’ quality. Though his physical body may be entirely
        changed through cell renewal many times in his life and eventually be dissolved
        into its constituent parts. In the sense referred to even the individual may be
        ‘continuous’, and the overlapping and interweaving of generations of
        communicating individuals make man, potentially, an organism which never
        sleeps, dies, or forgets &hellip;
